# Culminating-Work-Log
# ekans: snake like game, where you won't die hitting the walls, there are objects falling from directly above, and instead of a growing snake, a chain of people being saved by a knight, and he can run into a person to collect them, and then deliver them to the safe zone, while trying to collect coins, and shields to block from harmful things
# to see the amount of effort that goes into even the smallest of games, and the actual strength it takes to create a good one
# by the end of June, I would like to have a knowledgable understanding of pygame, and object manipulaiton along with simple animation within pygame
# my laptop, school computers, python, pygame, and anything else, maybe my vertical mouse too, idk yet, one of the buttons broke so maybe not
